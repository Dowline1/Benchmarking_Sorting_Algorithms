    "### Introduction\n",
    "Sorting algorithms in Python are functions which contain instructions and take an array as input, then perform sets of operations as specified in the function on the array and ouput the sorted area as per the instructions. At a high level there are two types of sorting algorithms <b>Comparison Based</b> sorting algorithms and <b>Non-Comparison Based</b> sorting Algorithms  (Moore, et al., n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Comarison Based Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "A comparison based sorting algorithm sorts an array by comparing each element of the array with the other elements of the array to determine if the element should be to the left or right of another element in the array. Although they are simpler to implement, comparison based sorting algorithms cannot be faster than $O(n log n)$ (Moore, et al., n.d.). These algorithms use <b>Compartor Functions</b> (>, <, =) in order to build the logic of the algorithm using the functions to build rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "As the name suggests Non-Comparison Based Sorting Algorithms do not make comparisons between the elements of the array passed into the function and so can be faster than $O(n log n)$ (Moore, et al., n.d.). These types of algorithms work by determining for each element in the array how many elements are less than that element and places that element to the right of all lesser elements. The element is placed into this particular slot striaght away and so there is no need to rearrange the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Complexity/Performance\n",
    "When determining the complexity of an algorithm we consider two things <b>Time Complexty</b> and <b>Space Complexity</b> determination of these two features of an algorithm are part of determining <b>Algorithm Performance</b> (Kulalvaimozhi, et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Time Complexity <img style=\"float: right;\" src=\"Images\\clocks.jpg\">\n",
    "With regard to Time Complexity there are three types to consider which are best also called Big Oh ($O$), average also called Big Theta ($Θ$) and worst also called Big Omega ($Ω$) cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Worst Case:</b>In this case the upper limit on running time of an algorithm is calculated which generally speaking occurs when the maximum number of operations getting executed over all of the inputs of size n. This occurs for example in Bubble sort if the array is reverse sorted the maximum number of comparisons occurs (Jain, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Average Case:</b>In order to calculate average case times all possible inputs and calculate the computing time for these inputs. Next the calculated values are summed and divided by the total number of inputs, the distribution of the cases must either be known or predicted for all of the datasets of size n (Jain, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Best Case:</b>For calculating best case the lower limit on running time of the algorithm i.e. the case which causes the minimum number of operations for an input of size n. In the case of Bubble Sort this occurs in the scenario whereby the input is already in a sorted state (Jain, 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Space Complexity <img style=\"float: right;\" width=\"300\" src=\"Images\\space.jpg\">\n",
    "Memory can be used up by algorithms by it's variables, program instructions and the algorithms execution, space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm including the input values to provide a result (Abhishek, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "A constant amount of space is used for <b>In-Place</b> sorting algorithms for sorting the array that is provided in that the modifications are done on the array elements within the array itself and does not use an additional space. Examples of inplace sorting algorithms include Insertion Sort and Selection Sort as not additioanl space is used for sorting compared with the likes of Merge Sort as it breaks the problem into smaller parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "When executing the memory taken up by an algorithm is used for three reasons \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Instruction Space:</b> Being the amount of memory space used to save the compiled version of the algorithm instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Environmental Stack:</b> As can be seen above in the main function of my benchmarking program, the algorithms for each sort method are called within this main function. When executed the variable are pushed onto the system stack temporarily while they await further instruction i.e. the main program variables will be stored temporarily while the sorting algorithms are called (Abhishek, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data Space:</b> The amount of memory taken up by variables and constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity however when calculated typically only considers data space and does not include the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sorting Algorithm Stability\n",
    "When it comes to sorting algorithms stability relates to how an algorithm sorts equal/repeated elements e.g.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5] 5 is repeated). In a <b>Stable Sorting</b> algorithm the order in which the the repeated elements remains the same as seen in the image below, whereas in <b>Non-Stable Sorting</b> algorithms the relative or initial order of equal elements can change  (Priyank, 2020).\n",
    "\n",

    "<img width=\"480\" align=\"right\" src=\"Images\\Non-Stable_Sorting.png\">"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Stability is not always necessary, in cases where all elements are unique or equal elements are indistinguishable stability is not required. If elements in an array are distinguishable then stability of a sorting algorithm is required, this can be very important where sorting on multiple fields e.g. Sourting Countries first by Name and then by Continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some sorting algorithms are stable without any modifications like Merge Sort, Timsort and Bubble Sort, unstable sorting algorithms can be modified to become stable with extra space being utilised to maintain there stability (Priyank, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubble Sort <img style=\"float: right;\" width=\"250\" src=\"Images\\bubble.jpg\">\n",
    "The Bubble Sort algorithmis is a stable comparison based sorting algorithm and can be traced back as far as 1956 in (Friend, 1956) when it was reffered to as \"sorting by exchange\" and not \"Bubble Sort\". It was named for how the algorithm works on the array, the largest number in the array bubbles up to the highest element position or the right most position in the array just as a pot boils water (Campbell, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a sorting algorithm Bubble Sort quite simply passes over each element in the array comparing each element to the element next to it. If the larger of the two elements is on the left then the element are swapped, this comparison is completed for each element until the entire array has been sorted and the largest element is in the highest or right most position of the array. In this manner the largest number is moved to the right until it is in the highest position, the algorithm then moves on until it finds the second largest element and moves it to the second highest position and so on an so forth (Campbell, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to sort an array of length n based on the above information it will take n passes of the algorithm over the array. The algorithm can also be further optimised by keeping track of the number of times the algorithm has passed over the array. Knowing this we can determine how many elements from the last have already been sorted i.e. after passing over the array 5 times we know that the last 5 elements of the array have been sorted so the algorithm must only asses up to the n-5 element (Campbell, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time/Space Complexity\n",
    "The worst case space complexity of Bubble Sort is $O(1)$ as the amount of space required for the algorithm is constant throughout the execution of the algorithm as the sorting is completed in place meaning only one temporary variable is being utilised.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of time complexity in its best case  i.e. in the unlikely scenario when the array is already in a sorted state the time complexity will be $Ω(n)$ as the algorithm will only pass through the elements of the array once to confirm that it is already in a sorted state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case for bubble sort will be $O(n^2)$ meaning that the array is sorted but in descending order, which means that the algorithm will need to pass through the entire array and swap each of the elements as it traverses the array n number of times in order to place each element in it's correct order.

    "### Heap Sort <img style=\"float: right;\" width=\"250\" src=\"Images\\tree.jpg\">\n",
    "Heap Sort is an unstable comparison based sorting algorithmn which sorts arrays with the use of binary trees, it was developed in 1964 by J. W. J. Williams (Williams, 1964). A <b>Complete Binary Tree</b> is a binary tree where all levels with the possibility of the last is filled with all nodes of the tree being as far to the left as possible (GeeksforGeeks, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next moving onto a <b>Binary Heap</b> which is a complete binary tree that is sorted i.e. the value of every parent node is greater than it's 1/2 child node(s) with the largest value being the <b>Max Heap</b> and the smallest being the <b>Min Heap</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Heap sort executes as follows (Diagram Below Execution Steps): \n",
    "1. The array is first represented as a binary tree. \n",
    "2. A Max Heap is built from the data inputted as we assume the data is not sorted.\n",
    "3. The Largest element of the max heap is swapped with the end or right most element of the array and removed from the binary tree with the removed element considered sorted.\n",
    "4. The right most element that was swapped with the largest element is now at the top of the tree.\n",
    "5. Heapify is then called which swaps the element at the top of the tree with the largest element in the tree.\n",
    "6. If the element that was swapped is smaller than it's child nodes it is swapped with a child node until it is in a position where it is smaller than it's parent node.\n",
    "7. We are now back to a Max Heap and the process executes again until every element has been sorted in this way.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Time/Space Complexity\n",
    "The worst case space complexity of Heap Sort is $O(1)$ as the amount of space required for the algorithm is constant throughout the execution of the algorithm as the sorting is completed in place and only temporary variables are used to swap around the variables during the build of the max heap and during heapification.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of time complexity heap sort has is $Ω(n log n)$ in best, worst and average cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the height of a complete binary tree containing n elements is $log(n)$, in the worst case scenario when an element must be moved from the root to the leaf node requires multiples of $log(n)$ comparisons and swaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "While building the max heaps the algorithm computes this for $n/2$ elements giving a worst case complexity of around $n log n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While heap sort is actually sorting the root element is exchanged with the last element and the heapify follows. For each of the elements undergoing this the worst time results in $logn$ and this is then repeated n times and so results in a time complexity of $n log n$ asall steps are executed in sequence the complexity is not multiplied (Jajodia, 2017)."
